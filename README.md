Triad AMS for Home Assistant
============================

A custom Home Assistant integration for controlling a Triad AMS 8x8 audio matrix switch over TCP. The integration exposes one media player entity per active output zone and lets you select a routed input, adjust volume, and optionally mirror metadata from an upstream media player entity.

Attribution: The device protocol and command bytes used by this integration were derived from the excellent work by Tim Weiler — https://github.com/tim-weiler/triad-audio-matrix. Thank you Tim!

Status
------
- Supported hardware:
  - Triad AMS 8x8 (Audio Matrix Switch)
  - Triad AMS 16x16 (Audio Matrix Switch)
  - Triad AMS 24x24 (Audio Matrix Switch)
- Transport: TCP (default port 52000)
- Discovery: Not implemented (manual host/port entry)

Features
--------
- One media player entity per active output (zone)
- Turn on/off a zone (routes/disconnects the source)
- Select source (routed input)
- Set volume per zone
- Optional input→entity linking
  - Link a Triad input to a Home Assistant `media_player` entity (e.g., Sonos)
  - Triad output entity proxies metadata (title/artist/album/artwork) from the linked player when that input is selected
- Simple config flow
  - Select device model (TS-AMS8, TS-AMS16, or TS-AMS24)
  - Choose which outputs and inputs are active
  - Optionally set a link for each input
- Service-based routing
  - `triad_ams.turn_on_with_source` for "route the input feeding entity X to zone Y" automations
  - `triad_ams.set_route` for direct `(output, input)` routing without involving HA entities (use `input: 0` to disconnect)
- Safe device handling
  - Serialized command writes
  - Trigger zone on when the first output is routed; off when the last output disconnects
  - Remembers and restores the last input when a zone is turned back on

Installation (HACS)
-------------------
This integration is available directly in HACS under the Integration category.

1. In Home Assistant, go to HACS → Integrations.
2. Search for "Triad AMS" and install.
3. Restart Home Assistant when prompted

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=bharat&repository=homeassistant-triad-ams)

Manual install (without HACS)
-----------------------------
- Copy the `custom_components/triad_ams` folder from this repository into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
- Restart Home Assistant

Configuration
-------------
1. Settings → Devices & Services → “Add Integration” → search for “Triad AMS”
2. Enter the Triad AMS host/IP and port (default 52000), and select your device model (TS-AMS8, TS-AMS16, or TS-AMS24)
3. In the next step:
   - Active Outputs: select which zones you want entities for
   - Active Inputs: select which inputs are usable as sources
   - Optional “link_input_<n>”: choose a `media_player` entity to mirror metadata when that input is routed
4. Save. The entry reloads and entities are created for active outputs only

Notes
-----
- You can rename outputs (zones) and set areas from each entity’s settings page
- If you later change the active lists or links in Options, the integration reloads and updates entities automatically
- The device model selected during initial setup determines the number of available inputs and outputs

Actions/Services
--------
- `triad_ams.turn_on_with_source` — entity service on a Triad AMS `media_player`. Takes an `input_entity_id` of another HA `media_player`; the integration looks up which Triad input is linked to that entity and routes it to the target zone. Best when both ends of the action are HA entities (the upstream source has a media_player and you want the zone to mirror it).
- `triad_ams.set_route` — global service. Takes two integers, `output` (1..N) and `input` (0..M); routes the input to the output directly. Use `input: 0` to disconnect the output. Best for headless or calibration automations that think in terms of physical port numbers rather than HA entities. Raises if more than one Triad AMS config entry is configured (no implicit broadcast).
- `triad_ams.set_protocol_debug` — toggles protocol-level logging across all configured entries. Field: `enabled: true|false`.

Known Limitations
-----------
- Only the Triad AMS 8x8 model has been confirmed with real hardware; the 16x16 and 24x24 are supported in code but untested.
- No automatic discovery — enter host/port manually.
- The device emits no state push; the integration reads state on demand and around actions.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Need protocol-level logging?
  - Enable the integration logger in `configuration.yaml`:
    - `logger.logs.custom_components.triad_ams: debug`
  - Toggle at runtime via the `triad_ams.set_protocol_debug` service (`enabled: true/false`).
- No inputs in the source list?
  - Make sure the inputs are marked active in Options
- Metadata not shown?
  - Set a `link_input_<n>` to the upstream player for that input; the Triad entity will proxy media fields only when linked and routed to that input
- Old output devices linger in the UI?
  - The integration prunes stale entities/devices on reload when outputs are deactivated. If you still see devices, check for disabled entities tied to them
